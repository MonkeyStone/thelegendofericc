## The Game

TLE is a turn-based single player rogue-like game made in Java with the help of ECS in Ashley. Our team wanted to try something new so we picked up game designing and we learn on the fly, so any suggestions would be highly appreciated. You can download and play our game (or even drop us some tests!) for free.

## Log

After the first sprint we ended up with some stupid mobs (rendering is done real time, the mobs can turn only after the player makes a move, there are no mobs collision yet)

For our first procedural map generation we implemented BSP algorithm, we do consider chaning it to tunelling one.
